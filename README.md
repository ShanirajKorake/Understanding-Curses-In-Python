# Understanding curses - Terminal UI with Python

This repository documents my journey of learning **curses**, a Python library for building terminal-based user interfaces. I'll be pushing small code snippets along with explanations as I explore different aspects of curses.

## 📌 What is curses?
**curses** is a Python module that provides a way to create interactive text-based user interfaces. It helps with:
- Handling **keyboard inputs**
- Managing **windows and panels**
- Drawing **text-based UI components**
- Creating **interactive CLI applications**

## 🔥 Why Learn curses?
Mastering curses allows building **powerful terminal applications** like:
- **File managers** (e.g., `yazi`, `ranger`)
- **System monitors** (e.g., `htop`)
- **Interactive dashboards**

This repo is my playground to experiment and improve. Feel free to explore or contribute!
